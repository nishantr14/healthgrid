# Cloud Run container for HealthGrid AI (Next.js standalone).
# Public NEXT_PUBLIC_* keys are baked at build time — they are client-side
# keys already shipped to every browser, so this is not a secret leak.
# Server secrets (GEMINI_API_KEY, FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_B64) are injected
# as Cloud Run runtime env vars, never baked here.
